# Guess My Number

Guess My Number is my very first JavaScript project.<br>
It is quite simple, and most likely uses old technologies.

## How to play

Well, you type in a number and then press `Check!`.<br>
Now it will display if you guessed too high or too low or if you were correct.<br>
The `Again!` button will reset the values except for the high score.

## How to run it

You can download the files and run it on your end by launching the index.html file in a browser,<br>
or you can visit [my homepage](https://renespies.me/guess-my-number) and play the game there. ðŸ˜Š
