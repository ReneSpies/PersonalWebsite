# The Pig Game

🐷

## How to play

It requires two players to play properly.<br>
Each player can roll a dice as often as they want.<br>
But if they roll a 1, their current score will be reset, and the other player gets to play.<br>
The active player can press the `Hold` button to persist their score. The first player to reach 💯 points wins.

## How to run it

You can download the files and run it on your end by launching the index.html file in a browser,<br>
or you can visit [my homepage](https://renespies.me/pig-game) and play the game there. 😊
